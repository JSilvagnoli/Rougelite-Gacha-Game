  characterName: Ethan Magus
  description: Ethan Magus, once a formidable sorcerer, grew disillusioned with the
    lackluster magical prowess of the world's sorcerers. Seeking greater challenges,
    he delved into dark magic at the Library of Knowledge, inadvertently summoning
    The Cataclysm. Stripped of his powers, he was rescued by a sorcerer monk who
    taught him basic magic and combat. Unsatisfied, Ethan confronted his master,
    resulting in the monk's death.  Driven by revenge, Ethan sought stronger magic
    and was lured by The Infernal Compendium to The Crystal Nexus. Attempting to
    claim its power, he unknowingly opened a portal for The Cataclysm, triggering
    The Convergence. Towers from The Dark Zone brought monstrous beings to Earth.
    Realizing his error, Ethan vowed to protect Earth, defeating the first tower.
    The Crystal Nexus transformed him into the Omnimancer Paragon, armed with The
    Illuminated Codex.  Now, Ethan seeks powerful allies to defeat the Towers and
    The Cataclysm, attaining redemption for his past actions.
