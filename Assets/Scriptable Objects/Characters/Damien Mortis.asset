  description: "Damien Mortis unintentionally found himself in the vicinity of a
    mysterious tower. As he ventured inside, the supernatural entities within proved
    overwhelming, leading to his demise. However, to Ethan Magus' astonishment, after
    clearly dying, Damien rose again, imbued with a newfound power \u2013 the ability
    to command the souls of defeated monsters. \n\nHaunted by his own death and rebirth,
    Damien embraced the dark gift bestowed upon him by the Tower. Rather than succumbing
    to the fear of his own demise, he sought to unravel the mysteries of the towers
    and the connection between life and death. As The Revenant Necromancer, he became
    an eerie force on the battlefield, turning the tide by reanimating defeated monsters
    to serve his bidding. \n\nWitnessing Damien's resolve and newfound powers, Ethan
    Magus recognized his potential and recruited him to the team. Now, Damien Mortis
    stands alongside other allies, ready to face the Towers and The Cataclysm, each
    with their unique abilities contributing to the battle against the encroaching
    darkness."
