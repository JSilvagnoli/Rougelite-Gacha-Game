  characterName: Jessica Night
  description: Jessica Night, a humble tavern worker, had her life changed one fateful
    night when confronted by two menacing monsters on her way home. Fueled by fear
    and a fierce determination, Jessica's latent magical abilities surged to the
    surface. Unbeknownst to her, she was a natural sorceress with unparalleled potential. 
    The magical outburst caught the attention of Ethan Magus, who recognized her
    extraordinary gift. Transporting Jessica to Magus Manor, Ethan explained the
    looming threat of The Cataclysm and his quest to assemble powerful allies. Recognizing
    Jessica's potential, he sent her to a mysterious tower, promising that if she
    conquered it, she would not only harness a deeper understanding of her powers
    but also become a valuable ally in the fight against The Cataclysm.  With ease,
    Jessica vanquished the tower's final boss, earning the moniker "Night Witch."
    Now, armed with newfound magical prowess, she joins Ethan Magus in the battle
    against the Towers and The Cataclysm, determined to explore the extent of her
    abilities and protect the world from the encroaching darkness.
