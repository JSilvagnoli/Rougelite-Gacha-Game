  - Welcome my humble abode. My name is Ethan Magus. I've been fighting the Cataclysm
    on my own, but the Cataclysm, it FEARS you. It fears the potential you have and
    that's why it sent you to the tower. But you not only gained a better understanding
    of your power in that tower, you DEFEATED it! I am gathering champions from across
    the land to take on the Cataclysm. Venture deeper into the tower and gather more
    allies. When you return summon a new ally and I will join you when you've gathered
    5 of them.
