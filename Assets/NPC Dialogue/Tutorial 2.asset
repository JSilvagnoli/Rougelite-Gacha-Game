  - Well, welcome back.
  - I honestly didn't think you would make it, but it seems like you've gotten a
    better understanding of your new powers.
  - Sorry for dragging you here out of nowhere and throwing you into that tower,
    but now you know exactly what we're dealing with.
  - Anyways, welcome to the team.
  - From now on it'll be up to you to recruit new members to the team.
  - My duty is to prevent the enemy from escaping the towers, and notifying your
    team when new towers appear.
  - Gather 5 new allies and I'll provide you my assistance during battle.
  - I would recommend speaking with the others here and getting yourself ready for
    the next tower.
  - You can always come talk to me if you need any help.
  - Good luck!
